# 🛡️ Hate Text Recognizer

A machine and deep learning-based application that identifies and flags hate speech or toxic text content. Built to promote safer online communication by automatically recognizing offensive or harmful language.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects hate speech and offensive language in text inputs.
- Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.
- Supports classification into hate speech, offensive, or neutral categories.
- Clean and simple user interface (if GUI is included).
- Easily deployable as a REST API or web app.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch *(choose your actual model library)*
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) / spaCy
- Pandas & NumPy
- Flask / Streamlit *(if applicable)*
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development and testing)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the [Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset](https://data.world/crowdflower/hate-speech-identification) or a similar publicly available corpus. The dataset includes labeled text samples categorized as:

- Hate Speech
- Offensive Language
